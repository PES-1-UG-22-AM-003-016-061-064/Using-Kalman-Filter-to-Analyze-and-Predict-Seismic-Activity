# Using Kalman Filter to Analyze and Predict Seismic Activity

### Project Title
Using Kalman filter to analyze and predict seismic activity

### Problem Statement
Develop and implement a Kalman filter-based model for analyzing real-time seismic activity data to accurately predict future seismic events and improve understanding of earthquake patterns and behaviors.

### Uniqueness
- **Kalman Filter Utilization**: Interpolating irregular earthquake data into a time sequential series.
- **Multiple Data Streams**: Integrating multiple streams of time series data from multiple neighboring sensor stations.
- **State Estimation and Prediction**: Leveraging Kalman filterâ€™s effectiveness in dynamic systems for better predictions compared to models like Bi-LSTM or ANN.

### Dataset
